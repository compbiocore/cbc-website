      text: "<p>The Core provides two distinct complimentary services  to all researchers at Brown.</p>
     <p><strong>Appointment Based</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;A team of experienced computational biologists and biostatisticians are on-hand to help investigators design experiments.</p>
     <p><strong>Weekly Consulting Sessions</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;The Core offers two hours *walk-in Consulting* sessions for all researchers to discuss any immediate issues  in data analysis including trouble-shooting code, help with statistical analysis and discussion of options for bioinformatic analysis. These consulting sessions are currently held at *BMC 405 1.30-3.30 pm on Wednesdayd*</p>"
      text2: "To avail of the consulting services please sign up below if you have not used the CBC services before. Use the scheduler below to reserve a slot for the weekly  consulting sessions and in the event that all slots are filled and you need an appointment sooner contact our **[helpdesk](mailto:cbc-help.brown.edu)**."
