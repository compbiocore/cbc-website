  lead: 'The Computational Biology Core (CBC) is a group of scientists, data scientists, and software engineers that support data-intensive research.'
  text: '<p>The near-term, primary mission of the CBC is to support junior Investigators in the analysis and interpretation of high-throughput DNA/RNA sequencing datasets, including data generated in their laboratories and large, publicly-available datasets. The Core also facilitates scientific interactions among the projects in the COBRE. The long-term goal of the CBC is to provide a sustainable resource to support data analysis challenges faced by genomic studies across Brown University and our Affiliated Hospitals. The Core also provides training for the broad research community to ensure the sustainability of the next cohort of junior investigators.</p>'
